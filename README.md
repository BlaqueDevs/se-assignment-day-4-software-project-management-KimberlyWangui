## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development, which emphasizes flexibility, collaboration and customer feedback and Waterfall is a linear sequential approach, where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
Agile Advantages
Quick response to changes.
Regular customer feedback.
Agile Disadvantages
Less predictability
Requires significant customer involvement.
Waterfall advantages
Clear structure and documentation.
Easy to manage due to its rigidity.
Waterfall disadvantages
Difficult to accommodate changes.
Testing occurs late in the process.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is best for projects that require flexibility, continuous feedback, and iterative development. It works well for software development startups where fast iterations and continuous feedback help refine the product while waterfall is best for structured, well defined projects with clear requirements and minimal expected changes, it works for government for enterprise software.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Requirement analysis and clear documentation.
Test driven development.
Code reviews and pair programming.
It's important in fixing defects early reduces time and expense, enhaces user satisfaction and Producing high quality products that gain customer loyalty.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining the project scope ensures that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of what the project will deliver and prevents scope creep.
A work breakdown schedule is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller, manageable tasks.
It helps with:
Breaking down complex projects.
Improving task delegation.
Enhancing Progress Tracking.
Rducing Project risks.
Optimizing resource allocation.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Improved Time management.
Better resource allocation.
Risk mitigation.
Increased accountability.
Cost efficiency.
A ganntt chart is a visual representation of a project schedule, showing tasks, dependencies and timelines. It tracks progress, manages dependencies and enhances team collaboration.
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience? 
An expense Tracker app, it aims to solve lack of financial awareness leading to overspending among the youth and help users make informed financial decisions that encourage better saving habits.
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Clearly defining the prroblem before development helps ensure that the software solution is relevant, efficient, and user centric. It ensures a focused development, better requirement gathering, improved user experience and efficient resource allocation.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
A smart and user-friendly financial management tool that helps user track expenses, set budgets, and gain insights into their spending habits. It empowers individuals to take control of their finances and make better financial decisions.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
